## Phase III: Engineering the Void (Weeks 5-7)
*How to store, search, and retrieve vectors at scale.*

### Week 5: Indexing & HNSW
**Topic:** How to search 100 million vectors in 10ms.

* **📖 Read:** [Pinecone: Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/)
    * **Focus:** The "Skip List" analogy. This is the best technical explanation of the algorithm available.

## Phase V: Final Project (Weeks 11-12)

### 🚀 Project Title: The Semantic Librarian

**The Prompt:**
> "Build a tool that allows a user to upload a PDF. The tool must visualize the PDF as a 'Galaxy of Concepts' (UMAP scatter plot). When the user clicks a cluster on the map, the LLM should summarize only that cluster."

**Required Tech Stack:**
* **Ingestion:** `PyPDF2` (to read the PDF) + `LangChain` (to chunk it).
* **Embedding:** OpenAI Embeddings or HuggingFace InstructEmbeddings.
* **Storage:** `ChromaDB` (Local Vector DB).
* **Visualization:** `UMAP` (dimensionality reduction) + `Plotly` (interactive charts).
* **Interface:** `Streamlit` (Web UI).

**Deliverables:**
1.  A GitHub repository with your code.
2.  A 2-minute Loom video demonstrating you "flying" through the data map and asking the LLM questions about specific clusters.
